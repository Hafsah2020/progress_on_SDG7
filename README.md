SDG 7 is one of the SDGs focused on making clean energy affordable and accessible by all by 2030.

By going through this analysis, you will discover that while some countries have their population or almost all their population with access to clean and affordable energy and some others do no not. This creates inequity and inequality.

As energy is a key factor to growth and development, someone in a country with less access won't be able to compete on the same grounds as someone in a country with more access .

A lot of climate issues are from energy generation, We all face the imapct of climate change but not every human on earth has access to energy for their daily activities

The targets of this SDG7 are:

* Target 7.1 : By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services 
* Target 7.2 : By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix
* Target 7.3 : By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency
* Target 7.a : By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology
* Target 7.b : By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support
